The "Pittsburgh Police Arrest Data" dataset comprises information regarding individuals apprehended by the Pittsburgh city police. The dataset stopped updating on November 14, 2023, due to a transition to a new records management system. This dataset exclusively contains records from the City of Pittsburgh Police, excluding incidents handled by other law enforcement bodies within the city, such as campus or Port Authority police.
